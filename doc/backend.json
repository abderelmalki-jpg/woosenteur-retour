    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to ensure secure access, scalability, and ease of debugging, adhering to the principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC, and QAPs.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** The structure uses path-based ownership for user-generated content (Products).  Each `Product` is stored under the `/users/{userId}/products/{productId}` path, making the user the implicit owner. No `get()` calls are needed to verify ownership, ensuring atomic operations.\n\n**Structural Segregation:**  User data and products are stored in separate collections under the user's document. This segregates data based on ownership, simplifying security rules.\n\n**Access Modeling:** The structure utilizes path-based ownership (`/users/{userId}/products/{productId}`). This pattern simplifies security rules and ensures that only the authenticated user can access their own products.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** Path-based ownership facilitates secure `list` operations. A user can easily list their own `Product` documents without exposing other users' data.\n\n**Invariants:**  Path-based ownership ensures the integrity of the user-product relationship. The `userId` is implicitly enforced by the path structure."
